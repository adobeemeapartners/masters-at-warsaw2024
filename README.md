## Goal

Learn how to demonstrate the value of Adobe Target on a real customer problem. 
Meet with the Adobe solution experts and level up your technical selling skills.

## Workshop Framing

Thanks for joining this event. You will soon learn more about the value and capabilities of Adobe Target, what problems it can solve, and how you can pitch it to your prospects. Later in the day, you will try to solve a real customer challenge using a ready-made Adobe Target sandbox. Finally, do a demo pitch yourself and get instant feedback from the Adobe experts.

Here is the workshop situation setup:

You've just completed the discovery and found a great solution with Adobe Target to solve your prospects challenge. You will be meeting with their representatives (incl. CMO, Marketing Manager, Optimization Expert, CRO) to present your pitch and show your solution in action.
	
Based on the given scenario, you will need to do the following:
	
* Explore the situation given the customer's current challenges (discovery).
* Discuss various options with your team mates (solution).
* Create a pitch and outline your solution to the customer representatives (presentation).
* With the demo environment at your fingertips, make yourself comfortable using it. Customize it and show it in action (demo).

## Customer Pitch

The whole presentation (pitch) shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes and will be followed by a short 5 mins Q&A.

When building your presentation try to consider these aspects of a great customer pitch:

* Collaboration and completeness,
* Potential value and viability of the idea,
* Innovation/Creativity,
* Demonstration - Focus on a customer journey and business value (not product capabilities).

## Breakouts

During the day, each of you will be assigned to a team. These teams will work on solving a specific scenario from a list we provide during the breakout session. But before we get into that, we'll show you how Adobe presents their ideas during a pitch. You can use this as a source of inspiration for your own assignment, and there will be plenty of time for you to ask questions to the experts from Adobe.
